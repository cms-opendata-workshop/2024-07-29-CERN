  Since 2014, the CMS Collaboration has pioneered the release of LHC research quality data for public
  use by making a significant amount of these data accessible through the CERN Open Data portal.  
  In April 2024, the CMS Collaboration released the first batch of "ultra-legacy" Run 2 data in the NanoAOD format.
  This workshop aims to bridge the technical gap that usually exists between the scientific creativity of an external 
  analyst and the nuts-and-bolts details of a full analysis with CMS open data.
  All exercises will be hands-on and participants should be prepared to dive into 
  the data right away. Before the workshop, participants should complete the software pre-exercises. During the workshop,
  participants will learn how to analyze CMS Open Data in the afternoons, and will have the chance to build out their
  research projects with expert help during the "hackathon" sessions in the morning.
